                    Repos keep copies of code that actually works, so experiments don't infect anything.
                    Multiple people can have access to the main code, but conflicting changes must be dealt with
                    before properly merging new code.

**Date: Jan/30/25** : Sandbox guy is here talking to us; I'm not really interested in making a company or full product, so I
                    feel like this isn't really for me. Oh well.
                    Also my anxiety could NEVER. Me oh my, too intense for my poor lil soul.
                    
                    User Stories - Start w/ the customer; Plan out customer experience, then build tech around that plan
                        As a  This kind of person
                        I want  Something
                        So that  This can happen
                    Project Estimation - Are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet are we th-
                        Tension between stakeholders(wants product finished now) and developers(knows that programming needs Time)
                        We don't always know how long anything will take, but we gotta say something
                        Number of hours is hard to say, but saying the date can cause others to believe you and have scheduled
                        things around you
                        Also if you say too long, you've padded the time
                        Level of difficulty is the vaguest, so it's most accurate b/c everyone needs a diff amount of time

                    Story Points - 2,3,5,8,13,21 easy -> hard
                        Measure of effort
                        Also account for lvl of uncertainty
                        How much can you do in a day?
                    Most of the time, work in 2/3 week sprints, which helps us choose which user stories to prioritize
                    Also, mid level effort consistently is better than occasional high effort
                    Velocity - points a team can do in a sprint; Takes like 6 sprints to get a decent measure
                    Burn Down Charts

                    Must, Should, Could, Would - MSCW or 'moscow'
                    Must and should usually get done, could rarely, would almost never.
