**Date: Jan/9/25** : Assess Capability, Lay out structure of the project (including reqs for design),
                    Implement Code, Use test cases, Repeat last two steps as needed, Deploy, Listen to
                    Feedback, Maintain
                    _Every Step costs more than the last_
                    (More work req'd down the line)

**Date: Jan/14/25** : Dad Joke made me laugh
                    Repos keep copies of code that actually works, so experiments don't infect anything.
                    Multiple people can have access to the main code, but conflicting changes must be dealt with
                    before properly merging new code.

**Date: Jan/16/25** : No class

**Date: Jan/21/25** : Stakeholders-
                    Business/Investors- Give a budget and asks for a return/profit; Often will give deadline

                    Product Managers- Also called "owners"; Outline what the product is going to be, Produce reqs,
                        Talk to Investors and Developers
                        _The most important factor in a software project, so better hope they're good_
                    Developers- Us
                    Technical Project Manager- Focus on technical work instead of the fun stuff

                    Operations and Support Teams- Interact with customers
                    Admin Support- The reason we can't download new fancy schmancy tools

**Date: Jan/30/25** : Sandbox guy is here talking to us; I'm not really interested in making a company or full product, so I
                    feel like this isn't really for me. Oh well.
                    Also my anxiety could NEVER. Me oh my, too intense for my poor lil soul.
                    
                    User Stories - Start w/ the customer; Plan out customer experience, then build tech around that plan
                        As a  This kind of person
                        I want  Something
                        So that  This can happen
                    Project Estimation - Are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet are we th-
                        Tension between stakeholders(wants product finished now) and developers(knows that programming needs Time)
                        We don't always know how long anything will take, but we gotta say something
                        Number of hours is hard to say, but saying the date can cause others to believe you and have scheduled
                        things around you
                        Also if you say too long, you've padded the time
                        Level of difficulty is the vaguest, so it's most accurate b/c everyone needs a diff amount of time

                    Story Points - 2,3,5,8,13,21 easy -> hard
                        Measure of effort
                        Also account for lvl of uncertainty
                        How much can you do in a day?
                    Most of the time, work in 2/3 week sprints, which helps us choose which user stories to prioritize
                    Also, mid level effort consistently is better than occasional high effort
                    Velocity - points a team can do in a sprint; Takes like 6 sprints to get a decent measure
                    Burn Down Charts

                    Must, Should, Could, Would - MSCW or 'moscow'
                    Must and should usually get done, could rarely, would almost never.

                        Technological Capability
                        Design Elements
                        Customer Needs
                        And with their powers combined, you get Software Architecture

                        Underlying structure with which everything sticks together
                        Your system will have an Architecture whether you like it or not, so be intentional about it.
                        Strange, organic growth will happen if you didn't plan from the get go.

                        People will try to say that x is 99% not going to happen. Unless you're completely certain, expect x to happen.
                        Also, if it's terrible and old, then it may sadly be too much trouble to overhaul it. So deal with stuff as
                        soon as possible.

                        Architects add value when they make correct technical decisions, enable communication, drive sound development
                        practices.

                        Complex, rapidly changing Landscape of Options
                        Time Pressure
                        Cost, Company Reqs, Affinity for the familiar, Incumbent Tech
                        Less that 10% of failed projects state 'wrong tech choice' as reason for failure.

                        There are certain design patterns that occur in real life, that have already been solved

                        Algorithm is a very specific pattern to solve a very specific problem in a very specific domain
                        Design Pattern is a very general pattern to solve a problem in many domains.

                        Observer Pattern: An object is being observed; change in the object sends a notification to observer
                            Take damage, status effect, Event handling, policy enforcement, online sales, cart mgt, Media 'algorithm'
                        Synchronous: concurency, consecutive sequence of events, one thing is waiting with baited breath for orders
                        Asynchronous: Waiting with not so baited breath. Chaos

                        Model-View-Controller: Almost every UI today
                        Model is data, the state of the system
                        View handles UI (both input and output)
                        Controller receives user info from the view

                        Thread: Subprograms that are running, updating things at the same time; Adds overhead

                        Adapter Pattern: creates a layer that changes formats, styles, or does 'bridging' activities
                            Enable integration
